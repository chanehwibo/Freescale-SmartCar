Since the competition took place a long time ago and there are no track elements available, the algorithm cannot cover new track elements from recent years. Readers may extend the algorithm by analogy to complete the missing lines.

If time permits, it is recommended to use MATLAB for image processing to achieve better image quality. For high-speed runs or the "Three-Meter God Car," this should definitely be considered.
